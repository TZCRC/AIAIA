# AI4Earth: AI Assisted Aerial Imagery Analysis for Wildlife Population and Human Conflict in Tanzania

Mitigating wildlife and human conflicts with AI, funded by Microsoft AI for Earth Innovation Grant and Global Wildlife Conservation.

## Labelling

Data labeling is done using [Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT)](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat) tool.

*Training dataset annotation workflow using CVAT. Aerial imagery was annotated by a group of volunteers in Tanzania. The annotators created 30 classes of labels that covered wildlife, livestock, and human activities. The final labeled data is tiled/chipped and converted into TFRecords format as machine learning ready data for the coming model training.*
### Aerial survey and the images

Aerial surveys of large mammals in Africa are normally done from light aircraft (Cessna 172/182/206 type) at an altitude above ground level (AGL) of 90-110m (300 to 350 feet).


There are two types of images that are available from aerial surveys for this project:

#### RSO

During the survey, Rear seat observers (RSO), window-mounted cameras are used to verify herd size and ID - they are triggered by the *human observer* when he/she sees a target of interest (all elephants, and larger herds of any species).
The aircaft flies straight lines (transects) back and forth over the target area.
  * These images are lower quality as they are taken through the Plexiglas.
  * Most images 24 megapixel (MP), taken at 35Â° down-angle from horizontal.
  * Very target-rich set of images which will produce many examples for training. This is because a human has *triggered* the camera on a target.
  * Arosund 20,000 images are currently available and being reviewed by the annotation lab.
  * GPS metadata are often not available (camera clocks not synchronized perfectly with GPS).


#### New aerial survey

The new system is for cameras on the wing struts which take constant images along flight paths.
  * These images have no intervening Plexiglas and are much higher quality.
  * Taken at 45Â° down-angle.
  * 24MP and optimized for image sharpness.
  * Very low rate of 'positives' - perhaps 2% of images will have any wildlife or livestock present.
  * Around 500,000 images are available.
  * GPS metadata present for all images.

## Training Data Generation with the aiaiatrain.azurecr.io/aiaia_tfrecord_eval_cpu container
The aiaiatrain.azurecr.io/aiaia_tfrecord_eval_cpu container has multiple uses: generating training data, running evaluation on model outputs, and serving as an interactive jupyter notebook server or testing server with pytest.

-  Build and access the container locally. This will take a long time to build depending on your internet connection. You can change the `docker-compose.yaml` file to have it build to support gpu, which will make evaluation faster.

```sh
docker-compose build
USERID=$(id -u) docker-compose run aiaiatrain.azurecr.io/aiaia_tfrecord_eval_cpu bash
```

Once in the docker container ,run the following commands ðŸ‘‡

## TFrecords creation

- Adding label_id, category and group in the CSV files

    From: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zWjgRcFwZh_OfpE8bUQoBBC3Imf8Ixua4eYBurjMUG4/edit#gid=0

```sh
python3 add_class_id.py \
    --csv=TA25_train_sliced_image_nbboxes.csv \
    --csv_output=TA25_train_sliced_image_nbboxes_class_id.csv
```

Files were stored at: `s3://aisurvey/training_data202008/P1000/*_train_sliced_image_nbboxes_class_id.csv`
They have been moved to the aiaiatrain container on Azure.

- Creating Tfrecords for object detection

```sh
python3 tf_records_creation.py \
    --tile_path=aisurvey/training_data202008/P1000/SL25_tiles \
    --csv=aisurvey/training_data202008/P1000/SL25_train_sliced_image_nbboxes_class_id.csv \
    --csv_class_map=aisurvey/class_map/class_map.csv \
    --output_dir=/aisurvey/training_data202008/P1000/SL25_tfrecord \
    --width=1000 \
    --height=1000
```

or execute the bash file:

```
./write_tfrecords.sh
```

## PBTXT creation

```
python3 write_training_pbtxt.py \
    --csv aisurvey/class_map/class_map.csv \
    --out_dir=aisurvey/training_data202008/P1000/pbtext/
```

outputs at: `s3://aisurvey/training_data202008/P1000/pbtxt`
They are also stored in the aiaiatrain container on Azure.

- Creating Tfrecords for classification

```sh
python3 tf_records_creation_classification.py \
        --tile_path=data/P400_v2/ \
        --csv_files=data/csv/*_class_id.csv \
        --output_dir=data/classification_training_tfrecords/ \
        --output_csv=data/csv/classification_training_tfrecords.csv
```

or execute the bash file:

```
./write_tfrecords_classification.sh

```

## AI-assisted Aerial Imagery Analysis (AIAIA)

At the end of the project, we present two AI-assisted systems: 1) an image classifier, AIAIA Classifier, that filters images containing objects of interest from tens of thousands of aerial images using automated camera systems and 2) a set of three object detection models, AIAIA Detectors, which locate, classify and count objects of interest within those images. The detected objects were assigned to image IDs that have their unique geolocation recorded during the aerial surveys. These geocoded detections were then used to generate maps of the distribution of wildlife, human activities, and livestock, with a visualisation of mapped proximity highlighting potential conflict areas. Explore the map here.

### AIAIA Detectors
All of the following paths are relative to the  `gcpprocessedtraining` container and can be downloaded locally, or mounted or downloaded to a VM. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-how-to-mount-container-linux
#### Building the training image
The training images have already been built and uploaded to an azure container registry named `aiaiatrain`. 
You can pull it to a VM or local machine with:

```bash
cd aiaia-detector
az acr login --name aiaiatrain # login to the azure container registry
docker run -u 0 --rm -v ./:/mnt/data -it aiaiatrain.azurecr.io/aiaia-tf1.15-frozen_graph:latest bash
```

If you need to build them and upload them again to ACR do the following.

To build the training image, run the following command, replacing `VERSION` with an
appropriate value (e.g., `v2`):

```bash
cd aiaia_detector/
bash build_azure_images.sh
docker push
```

See the README.md in the aiaia_detector folder for instructions on training.

#### Watching model training with Tensorboard

After an object detection model is trained and model checkpoints. You can go through these few steps to visualize the tensorboard output that you can also view during azureml training. (see README.md in the azure folder):

Download the outputs in `gcsprocessedtraining/azureml_outputs_detector/model_logs`

##### Visualize tensorboard locally

```bash
tensorboard --logdir='path/to/model_logs'
```

## Model inference

These scripts run model inference with frozen graph files (which end in `.pb`). We faced a latency issue running with TFserving images, so we recommend using the frozen_graph.pb files for the object detector and classifier inference.


### Running the inference script in local docker container

- Getting required files, download these to the folder mounted to the container.

```bash
cd AIAIA/inference
# create folder
mkdir -p models/wildlife
mkdir -p models/livestock
mkdir -p models/human-activities
mkdir -p data/chips/
# Downloading the frozen graph model, example chips, and pbtxt file of labels from gcsprocessedtraining
azcopy cp "https://aiaiatrain.blob.core.windows.net/gcsprocessedtraining/chips/*<SAS>" ./data/chips/ --recursive=true
azcopy cp "https://aiaiatrain.blob.core.windows.net/gcsprocessedtraining/root_data_for_azureml_detector/tf1models_p400/ryan_sprint_rcnn_resnet101_serengeti_wildlife_v3_tfs/frozen_inference_graph.pb<SAS>" ./models/wildlife/ --recursive=true
#note: the spaces in these urls are not typos. space characters left over when copying from gcp
azcopy cp "https://aiaiatrain.blob.core.windows.net/gcsprocessedtraining/root_data_for_azureml_detector/tf1models_p400/ rcnn_resnet101_serengeti_livestock_image_tensor/frozen_inference_graph.pb<SAS>" ./models/livestock
azcopy cp "https://aiaiatrain.blob.core.windows.net/gcsprocessedtraining/root_data_for_azureml_detector/tf1models_p400/ rcnn_resnet101_serengeti_human_activities_image_tensor/frozen_inference_graph.pb<SAS>" ./human-activities
azcopy cp "https://aiaiatrain.blob.core.windows.net/gcsprocessedtraining/chips/<SAS>" ./ --recursive=true

docker run -u 0 --rm -v $(pwd):/mnt/data -it aiaiatrain.azurecr.io/aiaia:v1-tf1.15-frozen-graph-cpu /bin/bash
```

- Executing prediction

```bash
# install some missing pip modules in the container. if the containers are rebuilt you won't need to pip install these since they are in the requirements-deploy.txt now
pip install numpyencoder click joblib tqdm

python frozen_graph/frozen_pred.py \
    --frozen_inference_graph=models/wildlife/frozen_inference_graph.pb \
    --images_path=data/chips/*.jpg \
    --threshold=0.5
```

The output will be store in the file: ` data/chips/`

### Running on NVIDIA GPU on top of classifier result

```bash
docker pull devseeddeploy/od_frozen_graph_inference:v1-tf1.15-gpu

docker run -u 0 --rm -v $(pwd):/mnt/data -it aiaiatrain.azurecr.io/aiaia:v1-tf1.15-frozen-graph-gpu /bin/bash
```
#### Filter image chips by the threshold score

This is optional if you have have result from an image classifier and only want to filter images that contains interested objects. The script was run on amazon aws and can be adapted to filter the results of the image classifier locally.

```bash
azcopy cp "https://aiaiatrain.blob.core.windows.net/gcsprocessedtraining/classification_inference<SAS>" ./classification_inference
```

```bash
python3 sync_s3_keys_from_classifier.py \
                      --df_name=classification_inference/rr19_sl25_0.5.csv \
                      --threshold=0.75 \
                      --profile_name=xxxx \ # requires access to s3 bucket
                      --bucket=xxx \ # requires access to s3 bucket
                      --dest_dir=chips_sl25_rr19_75

```

#### Running inference on filtered chips

Under the NVIDIA docker container run the following script to execute inference with frozen graph.


```bash
python3 frozen_graph/frozen_pred.py \
     --frozen_inference_graph=models/wildlife/frozen_inference_graph.pb \
     --images_path=chips_sl25_rr19_75/*/*.jpg \ # note that this is the same directory as the output of sync_s3_keys where the high confidence chips are saved int he previous code chunk^^^^
     --threshold=0.5 \
     --batch_size=100
```


#### Evaluation - Detectors

Evaluation was tested locally using the aiaiatrain.azurecr.io/aiaia_tfrecord_eval_gpu docker image, which can be built with

```
docker-compose build
```

from the aiaia_detector folder containing the `docker-compose` file. **Edit this file to build the image for the gpu if you are testing or running eval with a gpu**

After downloading the frozen graph model files and TFRecords for the test datasets, you can run the evaluation script `run_all_eval.sh` from within the docker container. **Make sure that paths in this script are correct for where you downloaded the files. You can move the folders use din the inference step above.** In this case, the script is run from the aiaia_detector folder.

If running on a local cpu or VM with no GPU
```
docker run -u 0 --rm -v ${PWD}:/mnt/data -p 8888:8888 -it aiaiatrain.azurecr.io/aiaia_tfrecord_eval_cpu:latest bash run_all_eval.sh
```

If running on a local gpu or VM with a GPU
```
docker run -u 0 --rm --gpus all -v ${PWD}:/mnt/data -p 8888:8888 -it aiaiatrain.azurecr.io/aiaia_tfrecord_eval_gpu:latest bash run_all_eval.sh
```

This will save all outputs from the evaluation to three folders, `wildlife-outputs`, `livestock-outputs`, `human-activities-outputs`.

To run the container interactively (remove the --gpus flag if there's no gpus)

```
docker run -u 0 --rm --gpus all -v ${PWD}:/mnt/data -p 8888:8888 -it aiaiatrain.azurecr.io/aiaia_tfrecord_eval_cpu:latest bash
```

In the container, to view the options for evaluation run:

```
python evaluation.py --help
```

You can run a jupyter notebook from within the container with

```
jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888 --no-browser --allow-root --notebook-dir=./
```

Or use the Remote - Containers VSCode extension to run commands from within the container or use the VSCode debugger to inspect the evaluation script.

Finally, to ensure that the evaluation script passes some simple tests, use pytest from within the container. This assumes the wildlife model is downloaded in the `aiaia_detector/aiaia_detector/tests` folder and is named `frozen_inference_graph.pb`, Run the tests like so:

```bash
cd ~/AIAIA/aiaia_detector
docker run -u 0 --rm -v $(pwd):/mnt/data -it aiaiatrain.azurecr.io/aiaia_tfrecord_eval_gpu:latest pytest aiaia_detector/tests/
```

To add another test, edit `tests/evaluation.py`

### Model evaluation - Classifier
All of the following paths are relative to the  `gcpprocessedtraining` container and can be downloaded locally, or mounted or downloaded to a VM. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-how-to-mount-container-linux

#### Running testing locally
Download TFRecords down from the folder `root_data_for_azureml_classifier/training_data_aiaia_p400/ classification_training_tfrecords` and edit the flags in the aiaia_classifier/eval.py code if needed based on your paths and where you downloaded the data.
Download the model checkpoint files from the best performing training step locally, these are in `classification_model_outputs/abc/`.
Run the `aiaiatrain.azurecr.io/aiaia_tfrecord_eval_cpu` docker container (see the following section on evaluating the AIAIA Detectors) in interactive mode with your local folder mounted. Within the container, run the following command:

```bash
python3 aiaia_classifier/eval.py \
       --tf_test_data_dir=dir_path_to_test_tfrecords/ \
       --country={country_name} \
       --tf_test_ckpt_path=dir_path_to_model_checkpoints/model.ckpt-6000 \
       --tf_test_results_dir=local_dir4_model_eval
```

The above command will output three files:
- `preds.csv`;
- `test_stats.csv`; and
- `dist_fpr_tpr_{countries}.png` and `roc_{countries}.png` that shows model true and false positive rate and roc curve. you can specify the `country` argument as an arbitrary identifier for your specific region.
- 
*Note*: currently, model parameters under `eval.py` are hard coded for this particular aiaia classifier model.
